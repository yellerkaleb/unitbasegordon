# UnitBase take-home by Gordon Jaja

- An interesting challenge to say the least
- It was difficult to decide on what to focus on, considering it's unrelated to Proptech and that the assignment involved code, backend and impressive UX
- I initially built an app named **SpaceInvaders** in about an hour, works ok, works on any browser, but the graphics are poor
- So decided to get best visual game engines, was between Unreal and Unity, chose Unreal for better graphics
- Spent 20+ hours building **ShooterGame** in Unreal Engine 5

## Space Invaders

- Fairly, self contained, uses react, and minor dependencies, 2D. Used AI to build it.
- 1 hour coding/modifying, 1100 lines, 20KB, code is self-contained
- App folder: `/SimpleHTML`
- To play simply double click on file `SpaceInvaders.html` or open in any browser

## Shooters

- Over 8 hours of tutorials
- 10+ hours of downloads and configuaration
- Coding was drag and drop mostly, with some minor C++ code
- Was fun, stressful, educational, complicated, challenging, great potential, I can finally say I built a game!
- 20+ hours coding/configuring, 3GB, distribution package 670MB, code is included
- App folder: `/App/Windows/`
- To play download App folder then run `ShooterGame.exe` on Windows only

## Conclusion

- Learned a new skill, always loved games, but this is first time writing one, had fun with it
- Although unrelated to Real Estate, or backend development, one thing I can appreciate is the blueprint workflow design in Unreal Engine's platform
- The workflow idea could be applied to Unit Base's architecture, and allow end-users' a custom design interface and workflow automation
